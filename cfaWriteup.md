# Data
The factor analysis model was fit to POD survey responses to 36 questions about six different aspects of campus accessibility:

 - tech (4 questions)
 - atti (6 questions)
 - comm (6 questions)
 - phys (6 questions)
 - serv (6 questions)
 - scap (10 questions)

We excluded data from 24 students who reported attending one of the "big 3" universities, i.e. Gallaudet University, Rochester Institute of Technology, and California State University, Northridge, (and included 0 students who did not respond to the question), leaving a total sample size of 234.

Survey questions were on a four-level Likert scale ("Not Likely," "Somewhat Likely," "Likely," "Extremely Likely").
For analysis, we dichotomized responses, so that a zero corresponds to a response of "Not Likely" or "Somewhat Likely" and a 1 corresponds to "Likely" or "Extremely Likely".

In a total of 863 cases (9.9%), respondents left a survey question blank.
